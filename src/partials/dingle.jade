em The Best of Dingle by Mab (Irish travel guru, Mother of the Bride):

    li The drive around the tip of the Dingle Peninsula is a must. There is a ring road called Slea Head Drive (R1559) that you can follow west out of town and it leads you in a big loop back to Dingle. Rick Steves (Ireland guidebook) describes all the sights along the way in detail so you can pick and choose when you want to stop depending on what kind of sights interest you. If you were to stop at only one sight that wasn't for the views or nourishment, (always stop for those) I would recommend the Great Blasket Centre. The design of the museum is genius. Exhibits lead visitors through the history and culture of the islands as well as physically through the building so that at the end you are viewing the islands themselves across the water. The  entire loop is about 50k. Averaging 30kph it would take about 1.5 hours, no stops. Add on from there.
    li Hike to the top of Mt Brandon (952 meters). I have not done it but I want to this time. Read the reviews on Trip Advisor. They are just regular people like us, right?  4-6 hours round trip. Easiest climb from the west out of Ballybrack and only if it is clear weather.
    li There are also many easy walks in the area. In town, to the lighthouse or to Eask Tower or at spots around the peninsula <a href="http://www.ireland.com/what-is-available/walking-and-hiking/amazing-places/dingle-peninsula/all/" target="_blank">described here</a>.
    li Inch Beach. What a spot!
    li Great traditional music sessions. Step into any pub and listen.
    li The Harry Clarke windows are masterpieces. Harry Clarke, considered Ireland's most famous stained glass artist, created 12 windows for the chapel inside St Joseph's Convent and Diseart (Green St.). There is a small charge for admission and an orientation video to view if you would like. When we were there in July, 2010 we had the place to ourselves for as long as we wanted.
