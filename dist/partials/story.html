<em>As told by Sarah:</em><p>I fell in love right away. Ansel was the first student to introduce himself in the first class of the first day of the first year of highschool. Pheromones, fate, or just the power of true love, I don’t know, but I was done. Ansel had me. It took a few years for us to get together though. Not to mention get our hair under control. One day we will tell our children all the angsty teenager drama we went through when they come home crying after a “boy-girl party” to make us both laugh. Then one dark winter night nine years ago I snuck downstairs, hid under a blanket, gathered my courage and whispered into the phone the one thing that I knew; that Ansel and I should be together. And Ansel agreed. We promised each other forever even before our first kiss. </p><p>That promise was certainly put to the test as we moved across the country together from Minneapolis to Seattle for college. Our first few years in Seattle were brutal as our dreams and identities were crushed and slowly rebuilt. And as Ansel likes to remind me, I cried everyday. But our commitment never wavered. Ansel was the light in my dark, and when I finally found my footing I found our love to be unbreakable and was looking forward to our future, if for nothing else, for just being with Ansel. </p><p>We like to joke that we are “boring and old” because when our peers head out to the bars we head to bed. But everyday's an adventure with Ansel. We adopted two kitty babies bursting with personality. We bought a “fixer upper” and have remodeled our way through room by room. We have traveled through Europe and will continue to travel the world. We are almost too busy visiting family and playing with friends. We play games and make bad jokes. We make up songs in the hardware store and ballroom dance in the kitchen. We lay in the dark laughing at the end of the day and wake up with a kiss. Although I thought I knew everything, I had no idea what love or this life together would be like when I was daydreaming about the boy with long hair when I was 15. But everyday with Ansel is better than I could have ever imagined. This wedding is a celebration of that. A recognition of all we have built and a moment to treasure all that is to come. We can’t wait to toast to it all in Ireland.</p><img src="/dist/img/engagement.jpg"/>
