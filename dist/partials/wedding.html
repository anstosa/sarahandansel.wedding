<p>July 26th, 2016. The ceremony location is still TBD! We are going to decide between two towers when we arrive in Dingle. Both are ~15 minutes from <a href="http://www.ballintaggarthouse.com/" target="_blank">Ballintaggart House</a>. We encourage you to gather at Ballintaggart at 3:30, so we can all caravan and carpool to the ceremony which will begin at 4pm, weather permitting.</p><p>The ceremony will be outdoors, and likely on a bluff. We encourage you to bring a wrap or jacket in case it is blustery :-)</p><p>After the ceremony, we invite you to return to Ballintaggart for cocktails, canap√©s, and Irish harp music.</p><p>Dinner reception will begin at 6:30 followed by toasts, cake, and a little bit of dancing! Although we won't have a full dance floor set up, following our first dance we will invite you all to join us on the dance floor for one concentrated celebratory dance song.</p><p>Before you depart for further adventures, we would love to give you one last hug at our farewell brunch. Enjoy some breakfast, coffee, and a final toast at Ballintaggart at 9:30am the morning of the 27th.</p><p>Day will be captured by <a href="http://taylorandporter.co.uk/" target="_blank">Taylor & Porter</a>.</p><img src="/dist/img/ballintaggart.jpg"/>
