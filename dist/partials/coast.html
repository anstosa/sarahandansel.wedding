<em>A Travel Guide by Mab (Irish travel guru, Mother of the Bride):</em><p><strong>To the north:</strong> If you are thinking of spending a few days before or after the wedding, the west coast north of Dingle would be a great option.</p><ul><li>If you want to see the Cliffs of Moher and beyond take <a href="http://www.discoverireland.ie/Activities-Adventure/killimer-tarbert-car-ferry/71068" target="_blank">the car ferry</a> from Tarbert (north of Tralee) to Killimer, County Clare.</li><li>The Cliffs are amazing but one of the most popular sights in all of Ireland so you will have company. This would be a very long day trip from Dingle but the journey would be beautiful too.</li><li>Exploring the moonscape of the Burren in Co Clare is other worldly dotted by ancient tombs.</li><li>Catch a ferry to the Aran Islands from Doolin. Most authentic place for purchasing your Aran Island sweater and on Inis Mor an easy bike ride brings you to the 3000 year old fort Dun Aonghasa, where there are no railings along the 100 meter high cliff at its edge.</li><li>Head further north to Galway. Great lively city without having to go to Dublin with a young vibe because of the University but also has an old town with windy, cobblestone streets. Galway is the gateway to Connemara, an ancient and spiritual landscape.</li><li>Head west out of Galway along the coast road and let the aura of the land seep into you. A stop in Roundstone for refreshment will wake you up and a master bodhran (hand-held celtic drum) maker has his studio and shop there. Northward to Clifden, Sky Rd, Kylemore Abbey, Connemara National Park and another unforgettable hike up Diamond Hill (well marked trail, 2-3 hours) and finally a drive through the valley between the Twelve Bens will test your will to return to Shannon and home.</li><li>Ideally this loop would take several days and there are many great B and B's along the way. Rick Steves does not write about Connemara in as much detail as Dingle but other guides like the Lonely Planet describe the area in exquisite detail so you can pick and choose what interests you enough for a stop. Castle ruins? Walks? Beaches? Museums? Festivals? Galloping a horse at the surf's edge? Pubs?</li></ul><p><strong>To the south</strong></p><ul><li>Directly south of the Dingle Peninsula is the Iveragh Peninsula which boasts the internationally famous Ring of Kerry. Like Slea Head at the end of the Dingle Peninsula, the Ring of Kerry is a loop drive. The peninsula is bigger, the drive longer. (Leave early and go clockwise to avoid the tour buses.) And while they are both spectacular drives and if you have time worth it. But if you are limited on time and have driven the loop near Dingle then I would concentrate on the east end of the peninsula between Kenmare (fun town with a stone circle near the town center) and Killarney (too crowded to stay in) and enjoy the interior beauty of the lakes and mountains. Staying any where near Lake Caragh would be amazing. Killarney National Park and Moll's Gap are stunning.</li><li>South of Kenmare is another peninsula, the Beara Peninsula. Many people prefer it to the other two because it has  much of the same scenery but few visitors. I haven't been out to the tip, where there is just a cable car to the very end, but the switchbacks over the Boggeragh Mountains through Healy Pass was exciting. You can follow the coast to Cork. The entire western coast is described in detail in <a href="http://www.wildatlanticway.com/home/" target="_blank">the Wild Atlantic Way</a>. Zigzag as you wish to catch interiors as well. <em>We</em> loved Guagan Barra Forest Park. Cork is the second largest city in the Republic of Ireland so you can get a taste of Irish city life here if you aren't going to make it to Dublin.</li><li>The Blarney Castle isn't far from Cork. We got there as it opened. Arriving any later and you will be stuck in a long line but we had the castle to ourselves besides the attendants who hold you feet so you don't fall to your death. As corny as it sounds the experience was very fun and you won't need to declare you new gift of blarney to US customs agents when you return.</li></ul>
