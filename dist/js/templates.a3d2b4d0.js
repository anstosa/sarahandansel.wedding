    "<em>A Dingle Accommodations Guide by (the irish travel guru and Mother of the Bride) Mab:</em><br><br><strong>General Tips:</strong><ul><li>B and B's and smaller guesthouses and inns which include breakfast with the rate are definitely the way to go (stay!) in Ireland. Hotels in Dingle are few and they typically don't offer the owner/host experience. If you feel the most comfortable booking a hotel I would definitely stay away from Dingle Skellig Hotel and Peninsula Spa. I walked by it in 2010 and it didn’t have much character.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com\" target=\"_blank\">TripAdvisor and <a href=\"http://www.bandbireland.com/\" target=\"_blank\">B & B Ireland</a> are great resources as is Rick Steve's guide.</a></li><li>One important amenity to decide on is location. If you want to walk home from the pub you will want to be in town. Be aware though that during the summer there will be action in town and it will run late so if you are not planning to be part of that action maybe a little outside of town would be quieter. Remember that the wedding reception venue is 5 minute drive east of town center but if you are driving nothing is that far even if you find your ideal spot west of town, just slow going on tiny, windy roads. Picturesque miles, not speedy ones.</li><li>If you are staying 3 nights or more you might want to look into self catering (although 3 or more nights minimum stays are fewer during peak summer months) - housing that is good for larger groups and cooking your own meals. Sites for searching : <a href=\"http://vrbo.com\" target=\"_blank\">VRBO</a>, TripAdvisor and <a href=\"http://www.ireland.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Ireland's official tourism website</a></li><li>“Holiday house\" usually means cookie cutouts side by side. Not a worthwhile experience for all the miles you are putting into journey to Dingle.</li></ul><strong>A few places to get you started:</strong><ul><li>There are good budget options - <a href=\"http://dinglegatehostel.com/\">Dingle Gate Hostel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.grapevinedingle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Grapevine Hostel</a>, and a not-a-hostel: <a href=\"http://dinglelastcottage.page.tl/About-Us.htm\">Last Cottage B & B</a>. But the mid-range options aren't that much more and there are dozens of those. I am not highlighting where I stayed before because it was nice but not great and you can find those on your own and with your own combo of desired amenities.</li><li><a href=\"http://homepage.eircom.net/~captigh/\" target=\"_blank\">The Captain's House</a> is old school, in town and offers suites up to 3 bedrooms.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.emlaghlodge.com/#home\" target=\"_blank\">Emlagh Lodge B & B</a> is new build, 5 minute stroll to town, gorgeous views and mid-range.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g211861-c2-Dingle_Dingle_Peninsula_County_Kerry-Hotels.html\" target=\"_blank\">Top 10 on TripAdvisor</a> all look great including the reception venue, Ballintaggert, which is a nice place to stay but it is full at the time of the wedding with Sarah, Ansel and their immediate families. Several of the top 10 are luxury accommodation ($$$) but you can also search by price, of course.</li></ul><p>That should get you started! Enjoy the search for your little piece of heaven.</p>"

    "<em>A Travel Guide by Mab (Irish travel guru, Mother of the Bride):</em><p><strong>To the north:</strong> If you are thinking of spending a few days before or after the wedding, the west coast north of Dingle would be a great option.</p><ul><li>If you want to see the Cliffs of Moher and beyond take <a href=\"http://www.discoverireland.ie/Activities-Adventure/killimer-tarbert-car-ferry/71068\" target=\"_blank\">the car ferry</a> from Tarbert (north of Tralee) to Killimer, County Clare.</li><li>The Cliffs are amazing but one of the most popular sights in all of Ireland so you will have company. This would be a very long day trip from Dingle but the journey would be beautiful too.</li><li>Exploring the moonscape of the Burren in Co Clare is other worldly dotted by ancient tombs.</li><li>Catch a ferry to the Aran Islands from Doolin. Most authentic place for purchasing your Aran Island sweater and on Inis Mor an easy bike ride brings you to the 3000 year old fort Dun Aonghasa, where there are no railings along the 100 meter high cliff at its edge.</li><li>Head further north to Galway. Great lively city without having to go to Dublin with a young vibe because of the University but also has an old town with windy, cobblestone streets. Galway is the gateway to Connemara, an ancient and spiritual landscape.</li><li>Head west out of Galway along the coast road and let the aura of the land seep into you. A stop in Roundstone for refreshment will wake you up and a master bodhran (hand-held celtic drum) maker has his studio and shop there. Northward to Clifden, Sky Rd, Kylemore Abbey, Connemara National Park and another unforgettable hike up Diamond Hill (well marked trail, 2-3 hours) and finally a drive through the valley between the Twelve Bens will test your will to return to Shannon and home.</li><li>Ideally this loop would take several days and there are many great B and B's along the way. Rick Steves does not write about Connemara in as much detail as Dingle but other guides like the Lonely Planet describe the area in exquisite detail so you can pick and choose what interests you enough for a stop. Castle ruins? Walks? Beaches? Museums? Festivals? Galloping a horse at the surf's edge? Pubs?</li></ul><p><strong>To the south</strong></p><ul><li>Directly south of the Dingle Peninsula is the Iveragh Peninsula which boasts the internationally famous Ring of Kerry. Like Slea Head at the end of the Dingle Peninsula, the Ring of Kerry is a loop drive. The peninsula is bigger, the drive longer. (Leave early and go clockwise to avoid the tour buses.) And while they are both spectacular drives and if you have time worth it. But if you are limited on time and have driven the loop near Dingle then I would concentrate on the east end of the peninsula between Kenmare (fun town with a stone circle near the town center) and Killarney (too crowded to stay in) and enjoy the interior beauty of the lakes and mountains. Staying any where near Lake Caragh would be amazing. Killarney National Park and Moll's Gap are stunning.</li><li>South of Kenmare is another peninsula, the Beara Peninsula. Many people prefer it to the other two because it has much of the same scenery but few visitors. I haven't been out to the tip, where there is just a cable car to the very end, but the switchbacks over the Boggeragh Mountains through Healy Pass was exciting. You can follow the coast to Cork. The entire western coast is described in detail in <a href=\"http://www.wildatlanticway.com/home/\" target=\"_blank\">the Wild Atlantic Way</a>. Zigzag as you wish to catch interiors as well. <em>We</em> loved Guagan Barra Forest Park. Cork is the second largest city in the Republic of Ireland so you can get a taste of Irish city life here if you aren't going to make it to Dublin.</li><li>The Blarney Castle isn't far from Cork. We got there as it opened. Arriving any later and you will be stuck in a long line but we had the castle to ourselves besides the attendants who hold you feet so you don't fall to your death. As corny as it sounds the experience was very fun and you won't need to declare you new gift of blarney to US customs agents when you return.</li></ul>"

    "<em>The Best of Dingle by Mab (Irish travel guru, Mother of the Bride):</em><ol><li>The drive around the tip of the Dingle Peninsula is a must. There is a ring road called Slea Head Drive (R1559) that you can follow west out of town and it leads you in a big loop back to Dingle. Rick Steves (Ireland guidebook) describes all the sights along the way in detail so you can pick and choose when you want to stop depending on what kind of sights interest you. If you were to stop at only one sight that wasn't for the views or nourishment, (always stop for those) I would recommend the Great Blasket Centre. The design of the museum is genius. Exhibits lead visitors through the history and culture of the islands as well as physically through the building so that at the end you are viewing the islands themselves across the water. The entire loop is about 50k. Averaging 30kph it would take about 1.5 hours, no stops. Add on from there.</li><li>Hike to the top of Mt Brandon (952 meters). I have not done it but I want to this time. Read the reviews on Trip Advisor. They are just regular people like us, right? 4-6 hours round trip. Easiest climb from the west out of Ballybrack and only if it is clear weather.</li><li>There are also many easy walks in the area. In town, to the lighthouse or to Eask Tower or at spots around the peninsula <a href=\"http://www.ireland.com/what-is-available/walking-and-hiking/amazing-places/dingle-peninsula/all/\" target=\"_blank\">described here</a>.</li><li>Inch Beach. What a spot!</li><li>Great traditional music sessions. Step into any pub and listen.</li><li>The Harry Clarke windows are masterpieces. Harry Clarke, considered Ireland's most famous stained glass artist, created 12 windows for the chapel inside St Joseph's Convent and Diseart (Green St.). There is a small charge for admission and an orientation video to view if you would like. When we were there in July, 2010 we had the place to ourselves for as long as we wanted.</li></ol>"

    "<em>A collection of tips submitted by the Sutin-Nulty-Vance-Smart family:</em><ul><li>Don't forget the outlet adapter! (or a voltage adapter if you plan on bringing a hair dryer or straightener)</li><li>Watch some YouTube videos about driving on the other side of the road! Learn to love roundabouts!</li><li>Bring warm clothes (including to sleep in as beds can be damp) and hiking shoes that can get muddy.</li><li>Get ready to ditch the coffee and embrace tea!</li><li>Put your best manual transmission driver at the wheel. Automatic transmission rental rates are much higher. Remember you will be changing gears with your left hand - an advantage for left handed people.</li><li>Check to see if the credit card you will be using covers car rental insurance in Ireland. If not, get another one that does. This is not to terrify you but just to give you a healthy heads up for the crazy fun ahead.</li><li>If you start up a conversation you might be there awhile. Don't be in a hurry. Listening to the stories in an Irish accent accent is heavenly.</li><li>Cool weather, even in the summer. Beaches are beautiful on the west coast and the Irish swim and surf. Brrr. Gazing is so much warmer but give it a go if you dare.</li><li>Kids are welcome in pubs, so if someone tugs at your leg in a pub, it might not be a leprechaun, but if it is, don't ask to see his pot of gold.</li><li>Irish soda bread is one of the great breads of the world. Keep an eye out for bakeries selling it fresh and rip off a piece to chew as soon as you have made your purchase.</li><li>Vegetarians and Gluten Free people really can’t go wrong ordering the house vegetable soup when in a pub.</li><li>Familiarize yourself with the Irish cultural legends that constantly appear in travel guides and general conversation - e.g. James Joyce, WB Yeats, Maureen O'Hara, Sinead O'Connor, Samuel Beckett, Oscar Wilde. It helps to know what the IRA is and some of the history behind Ireland's independence - Wikipedia will do.</li><li>You can never bring too many ziploc bags.</li><li>Binge watch Father Ted on Hulu to get a taste of bad Irish humor.</li></ul>"

    "<em>As told by Sarah:</em><p>I fell in love right away. Ansel was the first student to introduce himself in the first class of the first day of the first year of highschool. Pheromones, fate, or just the power of true love, I don’t know, but I was done. Ansel had me. It took a few years for us to get together though. Not to mention get our hair under control. One day we will tell our children all the angsty teenager drama we went through when they come home crying after a “boy-girl party” to make us both laugh. Then one dark winter night nine years ago I snuck downstairs, hid under a blanket, gathered my courage and whispered into the phone the one thing that I knew; that Ansel and I should be together. And Ansel agreed. We promised each other forever even before our first kiss.</p><p>That promise was certainly put to the test as we moved across the country together from Minneapolis to Seattle for college. Our first few years in Seattle were brutal as our dreams and identities were crushed and slowly rebuilt. And as Ansel likes to remind me, I cried everyday. But our commitment never wavered. Ansel was the light in my dark, and when I finally found my footing I found our love to be unbreakable and was looking forward to our future, if for nothing else, for just being with Ansel.</p><p>We like to joke that we are “boring and old” because when our peers head out to the bars we head to bed. But everyday's an adventure with Ansel. We adopted two kitty babies bursting with personality. We bought a “fixer upper” and have remodeled our way through room by room. We have traveled through Europe and will continue to travel the world. We are almost too busy visiting family and playing with friends. We play games and make bad jokes. We make up songs in the hardware store and ballroom dance in the kitchen. We lay in the dark laughing at the end of the day and wake up with a kiss. Although I thought I knew everything, I had no idea what love or this life together would be like when I was daydreaming about the boy with long hair when I was 15. But everyday with Ansel is better than I could have ever imagined. This wedding is a celebration of that. A recognition of all we have built and a moment to treasure all that is to come. We can’t wait to toast to it all in Ireland.</p><img src=\"/dist/img/engagement.jpg\">"
